These are the notes from MATH222. The .sty file is required if you wish to download the .tex files, edit them, and recompile them. The .sty file is a package I made for myself in order to get rid of a lot of the boilerplate commands and definitions I had to do at the beginning of each file.

Feel free to make a pull request with any errors you see. Otherwise, you can message me on Facebook or create an Issue.
